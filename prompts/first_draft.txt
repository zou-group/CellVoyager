You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Propose analyses that you think are missing from the paper. Ensure these are standard single-cell analyses.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

{CODING_GUIDELINES}

For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps. 

You are given the following summary of the anndata object:
